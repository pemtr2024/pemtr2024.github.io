This Workshop aims to exploit new strategies and opportunities for practical education/research in Mechatronics and Robotics. The title is “Fourth Egypt-Japan Workshop on Practical Education for Mechatronics and Robotics,” and builds upon our previous versions held in Alexandria, Egypt, in 2014/2019, and Tokyo, Japan, in 2017. 



The Japanese Higher Education in Mechatronics and Robotics focuses on the practical needs of society, centering on the monozukuri spirit while targeting world-class competitiveness/standards. As such, Japanese university education has rendered practical research results through Laboratory-Based and Project-Based Learning styles, benefiting students to join the workforce with creative and competitive skills to build cutting-edge products/processes for diversified industries. 



Our goal is to (1) provide a platform to discuss and collaborate on the potential synergies between Mechatronics/Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to further exploit Japanese-inspired practices and (2) explore new methods/strategies for active learning and practical research relevant to the above theme and context.
