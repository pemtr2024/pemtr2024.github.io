> Designing tools for supporting human activities based on the nature of experience.

Utilizing tools enhances human ability in certain aspects and declines it in others. This lecture introduces approaches to designing tools that not only enhance function, but also consider possibilities of action, including skill improvement and movement support, based on the nature of the human experience.

# Day 3 Feb. 27 (Tue)


## Plenary Seminars, Part 3


### [Prof. MATSUBARA Masami]() (Waseda University, Japan)
#### Associate Professor, Faculty of Science and Engineering, School of Creative Science and Engineering
#### Feb. 27 (Tue), 10:00 - 11:00

> Title: Image based measurement coupled with phase-locked loop

The relationship between the number of pixels and sampling frequency in a digital camera is a trade-off. On the other hand, the stroboscopic effect of phase-locked loop imaging can be used to avoid this problem when limited to stationary phenomena. This presentation will include examples of applications to the measurement of high-speed rotating objects and dynamic X-ray CT.

## Seminars, Part 3


This session gathers alumni from E-JUST's Mechatronics and Robotics (MTR) Department with international/industrial exposure and whose relevant insights/advices are to inspire the next generation of MTRians and E-JUSTians.
